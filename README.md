# 🏗 Scaffold-eth
> is everything you need to build decentralized applications on Ethereum! 🚀

At the heart of 🏗 Scaffold-eth is the ability to quickly iterate on Solidity and experiment with YourContract from React:

Getting your web3 dev stack up and running is difficult and prone to mistakes, that's why 🏗 Scaffold-eth comes with everything you need:

- Hardhat for your local blockchain, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- React for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made components and hooks.
- Ant for your UI. (You can easily changed to another library you prefer)
- Surge / S3 / IPFS for publishing your app.
- Tenderly / The Graph / Etherscan / Infura / Blocknative for infrastructure.
- Support for L2 / Sidechains like Optimism and Arbitrum.

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

⚠️ First, make sure you have: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

If everything goes smoothly you should now have a local network running, with the starter contracts deployed and the frontend React app running on https://localhost:3000.
